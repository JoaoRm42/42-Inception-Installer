# 42-Inception-Installer
The Inception Project Setup Script is a comprehensive automation tool designed to streamline the initial setup process for the Inception project.
This script ensures that all necessary dependencies, tools, and configurations are properly installed and configured, allowing developers to focus on the core aspects of their work without the hassle of manual setup.
The script is still being developed so any error you encounter you can always create an issue :)

# To get it to WORK!
# 1) This script is to be used in Debian 11 (That's where i tested it)
# 2) You have to add your user to the sudoers before executing this script, otherwise it won't work since it won't have the necessary permissions to install the dependencies for this project
