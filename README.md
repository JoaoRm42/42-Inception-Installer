# 42-Inception-Installer
The Inception Project Setup Script is a comprehensive automation tool designed to streamline the initial setup process for the Inception project.
This script ensures that all necessary dependencies, tools, and configurations are properly installed and configured, allowing developers to focus on the core aspects of their work without the hassle of manual setup.
The script is still being developed so any error you encounter you can always create an issue :)
